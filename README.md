# Nestor

NESTOR is a virtual room platform that connects mentees and mentors.
Using Virtual room technology that is becoming a more acceptable form of communication, we are creating a platform to make it easy for underrepresented youth to find someone to talk to in real time, and get a head start on their future. For mentors, Nestor makes it easy to pay it forward.

With NESTOR our vision is to bridge this gap early on, so that young people are ready and have a fair chance of availing the opportunities ahead of them.
